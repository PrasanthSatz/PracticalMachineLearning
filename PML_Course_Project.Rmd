# Background
A number of devices are currently available to monitor physical activities. Many of these devices have 
undergone testing to ensure they can monitor different types of physical activity accurately. This project
is using a dataset available under the creative common license to analyze how well a machine learning
algorithm can determine the different physical activities. The dataset consists of output from 
accelerotmeters on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants as they performed barbell lifts
in several different ways. More information is available from the website here: [HAR Dataset][1]

# Training Set Analysis
```{r, #Read in training set and start pre-processing}
#Read in the training set
Raw_Training_Set <- read.csv("Training_Set.csv")

#A visual inspection of the data shows that many of the columns are filled with NAs or are empty. In order
#to reduce the size of the dataset and limit it to the most useful information, the script will screen out
#variables will a large proportion of empty or NA values

Unique_ColNames <- colnames(Raw_Training_Set)

Count_Percent_Empty <- function(ColumnName){
    Column_of_Interest <- Raw_Training_Set[, c(ColumnName)]
    Count_of_Mostly_Empty <- length(Column_of_Interest[(is.na(Column_of_Interest))|
                                                       (Column_of_Interest=="")])
    Percent_Not_Helpful <- round(Count_of_Mostly_Empty/nrow(Raw_Training_Set)*100, 2)
    data.frame(Column=ColumnName, Percent_Empty=Percent_Not_Helpful)
}

Useful_Data_Counts <- ldply(Unique_ColNames, Count_Percent_Empty)

Columns_to_Keep <- as.character(Useful_Data_Counts$Column[Useful_Data_Counts$Percent_Empty < 10])

Trimmed_Training_Set <- Raw_Training_Set[, Columns_to_Keep]
```

After removing empty and null columns, the trimmed training set still contains information regarding
time, username, and an index. In order to see if the training set will need to be split into equal time
slices, I examined the time variables relative to exercise and user/participant.

```{r}
#Is there an association with time and exercise?
ggplot(Trimmed_Training_Set, aes(x=cvtd_timestamp, y=roll_belt, colour=classe)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```
Based on this graph it appears that the exercises were performed sequentially. In this case time would
have a high association with exercises and should **not** be included in the model development.


```{r}
#Is there an association with user and time
ggplot(Trimmed_Training_Set, aes(x=cvtd_timestamp, y=roll_belt, colour=user_name)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
```
This figure shows that time is strongly associated with user. In this case user should also be excluded
from the model. The seperation between the sets of users suggests that multiple instruments may have been
used during the experiment. Based on these figures I plan to remove the index, user name, time data and 
the data "window" columns.

#Model Selection
As several of the variables are bi-modal (e.g "roll_belt"), I decided on using a tree based model. The 
intial exploratory analysis with a simple decision tree showed it was not sufficient to the dataset 
appropriately (~54%). In this case a random forest was selected.

```{r, #Final Data Trimming}
Cols_to_Remove <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp",
                    "new_window", "num_window")

#As the time variables are linked heavily with excercise and user they are removed
Trimmed_Training_Setv2 <- Trimmed_Training_Set[, !(colnames(Trimmed_Training_Set) %in% Cols_to_Remove)]

#Split the training data into a training and test set for cross-validation
set.seed(125)
inTrain = createDataPartition(Trimmed_Training_Setv2$classe, p = 0.6, list=FALSE)
TrainTraining <- Trimmed_Training_Setv2[inTrain, ]
TestTraining <- Trimmed_Training_Setv2[-inTrain, ]

#Generate the model based on the training set
if(file.exists("RF_ModelFit_Fixed.RData")){
    load("RF_ModelFit_Fixed.RData")
}else{
    print("The Model has not yet been generated. This may take awhile. Estimated time 1.5 hrs")
    set.seed(1337)
    ModelFit <- train(classe~., method="rf", data=TrainTraining,
                      preprocess=c("center", "scale"))
    save(ModelFit, file="RF_ModelFit_Fixed.RData")
}

Test_Pred <- predict(ModelFit, newdata=TestTraining)

confusionMatrix(Test_Pred, TestTraining$classe)
```

# Summary
A random forest model was able to get 98.75% out of sample accuracy. This is comparable to the
[HAR Dataset][1], which had an accuracy of 99.41%.This would suggest that the model may be an excellent
fit for this dataset. The model was then applied to the 20 samples within the test set.

# Results
```{r, #Evaluate Model on Test Set}
Test_set <- read.csv("Test_Set.csv")
Test_set <- Test_set[, colnames(Test_set) %in% colnames(Trimmed_Training_Setv2)]

Test_Pred <- as.character(predict(ModelFit, newdata=Test_set))
```

The Test prediction outputs were then placed into individual files for grading on Coursera using the 
following code.

```{r, #Output Test Set Prediction}
pml_write_files = function(x){
    n = length(x)
    for(i in 1:n){
        filename = paste0("./Test_Predictions/problem_id_", i, ".txt")
        write.table(x[i], file=filename, quote=FALSE, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
    }
}

pml_write_files(Test_Pred)

```

Each of the text files was then loaded into Coursera for grading under course project area. The
submission process confirmed that we obtained perfect accurary (20 out of 20) for the test dataset.

# Update
This report was updated on `r Sys.Date()` to include recommendations after the peer review. This analysis
was performed on a machine with the following information:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
